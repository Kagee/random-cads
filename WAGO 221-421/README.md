## Just use the one on GrabCAD!
For people who just say *"use the one on GrabCAD"*, yes, there are "free" models out there, but they all appear to be ripped from the original Wago source. 

Let me give you some quotes from the license text for partcommunity.com that WAGO uses, and from the license for CADs from JST and McMaster-Carr:

### WAGO / partcommunity.com
> The customer may use the retrieved data for personal uses only.
> 
> The following use of data ... is strictly prohibited: ... The production of additional copies of the downloaded data for personal scientific use, if carried out for commercial purposes and the inclusion of additional copies in personal files, even if this is for the customerâ€™s own information and concerns daily demands.
> 
> ... the retrieved data may not be ceded to third parties, distributed, or communicated to the public.

### JST:
> Disclosure or leakage of downloaded document and information contained is strictly prohibited.

### McMaster-Carr:
> You shall not otherwise redistribute or make available the CAD models (or any design drawings or prototypes that incorporate them) to any third parties ...

### And for GrabCAD itself
... unless the files specifically include a license, the uploader only grats usage of the CAD models ...
>  for such user's own benefit and non-commercial, internal use
